# Cash Stream

Web application to facilitate real-time crypto payment.

## Architecture

Front End: React

Back End: Superfluid SDK Core

[Superfluid](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/) is a smart contract framework on EVM that enables money streaming.
It provides a [SDK core](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-core), a JS/TS wrapper library that enables Front End developers to use Superfluid without prior Solidity experience.
